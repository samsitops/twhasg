/*
 * Import styles from the Book An Appointment component SCSS file.
 * 
 * Note:
 * - This imports only the SCSS/CSS styles, not the Angular component TypeScript or HTML files.
 * - Make sure the path and file extension are correct (should point to a .scss file).
 * - Angular components should be imported and used via TypeScript and templates, not via SCSS imports.
