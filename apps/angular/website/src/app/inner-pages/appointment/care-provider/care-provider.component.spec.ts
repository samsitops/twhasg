/**
 * Unit tests for CareProviderComponent
 *
 * This test suite ensures that the CareProviderComponent:
 * - Is created successfully without errors.
 * - Can be instantiated by Angular's TestBed.
 *
 * Setup:
 * - Uses Angular's TestBed to configure testing environment.
 * - Imports CareProviderComponent as a standalone component/module.
 *
 * Tests:
 * - Checks if the component instance is truthy (created successfully).
 *
 * Note:
 * - Additional tests should be added here to cover component logic, form handling,
 *   input validation, event handling, and interaction with services if applicable.
