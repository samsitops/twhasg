/**
 * ProviderPortalComponent
 * ----------------------
 * A standalone Angular component providing a provider partnership portal form.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Displays a detailed form for providers to submit partnership interest and details.
 * - Uses reactive forms with validation for user input fields.
 * - Supports dynamic toggling of expanded content and "Other" checkbox logic.
 * - Sends form data via an injected SendEmailService to send partnership emails.
 * - Shows confirmation modal and toast notifications upon success or failure.
 * - Incorporates common layout components: Navbar, Footer, and Angular common directives.
 * 
 * Form Fields:
 * - Provider details: name, specialty, address, phone, email, website, full name, NPI, role.
 * - Partnership interests including value-based care, shared care collaboration, and other.
 * - Agreement checkbox for terms acceptance.
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - Angular Forms (ReactiveFormsModule, FormsModule)
 * - ngx-toastr for toast notifications
 * - ngx-bootstrap modal for modals
 * - Email sending via SendEmailService (wraps emailjs or other API)
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Place <app-provider-portal> selector in the Angular template.
 * - Ensure providers like ToastrService, BsModalService, and SendEmailService are configured in app module or component.
 * 
 * Accessibility:
 * - Uses standard Angular reactive forms with validation messages (not shown here).
 * - Modal and toast notifications provide user feedback.
