                                Sleep apnea is a condition where your breathing repeatedly stops and starts during
                                sleep. It can lead to snoring, fatigue, and serious health issues like heart disease if
                                untreated. Treatment options include CPAP therapy, oral appliances, weight management,
                                and in some cases, surgery.

                                Yes, insomnia can often be treated without medication through Cognitive Behavioral
                                Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), which helps you change thoughts and habits affecting your
                                sleep. Relaxation techniques and lifestyle adjustments also play a role.

                                issues early, improves chronic disease management, and supports better overall health
